## Project
* Comparison of LoRa and APRS for Smart Farm
  Studied the one that was delivered further, at a lower cost, between LoRa and APRS at Smart Farm
  Explained the reason for the actual network communication distance shorter than the expected network distance of APRS with the application of Fresnel Zone
  Calculated expecting networking distances by the Friis Transmission formula
* Prediction of a Person's Body Fat and Metabolic Syndrome by Physical Data
  Developing a regressor using a machine learning model based on physical data that returns predictions when entering physical data
* AI Speech Recognition Application for the Articulation Disorder
  Deeplearning
