## Education
- **Handong University**, 2014 Mar - 2021 Feb, Pohang, Republic of Korea
    - B.S. in Computer Science and Engineering   
- **Purdue University**, 2019 Sep - 2019 Dec, West lafayette, IN
    - Department of Computer and Information Technology
    - _sponsored by Korean Government_

## Project
- **Classify Words of a Person with Articulation Disorder**   
    > Developed CNN model classified 9 words of a person with an articulation disorder   
    > Used Python, Tensorflow, Keras, Google Colab   
    > [github](https://github.com/dlgur1994/Classify-Words-of-a-Person-with-Articulation-Disorder-using-Deep-Learning)

- **Predict Body Fat Percentage using Machine Learning**   
    > Developed a regressor using a machine learning model based on physical data that returned predictions when entering physical data   
    > Used Python, Machine Learning, Jupyter, Git, Flask   
    > [github](https://github.com/dlgur1994/Predict-Body-Fat-Percentage-using-Machine-Learning)

- **Compare LoRa and APRS for Smart Farm**   
    > Compared LoRa and APRS to find out which was more suitable for long-distance communication on Smart Farm   
    > Calculated expecting networking distances by the Friis Transmission formula 
    > Explained the reason for the actual network communication distance shorter than the expected network distance of APRS with the application of Fresnel Zone   
    > Wrote a paper and approved by IEEE International Conference on Omni-layer Intelligent Systems   
    > Used: Arduino, Antennas, Bread board, HX1 chip, LoRa shield, Spectrum analyzer
