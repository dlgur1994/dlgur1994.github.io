### 1. History of Computer Vision
- Camera Obscura, 16th century
- Hubel & Wiesel, 1959: visual processing mechanism with cats
- Block World, Larry Roberts, 1963: geometric simplification of objects
- MIT "The Summer Vision Project", 1966: recogniztion with computers
- Dabid Marr, late 1970s: Input -> Primal Sketch -> 2 1/2-D sketch -> 3-D Model Representation
- Pictorial Structure, 1973
- Generalized Cylinder, 1979
- David Lowe, 1987
- Normalized Cut, 1997: image segmentation
- Dabid Lowe, "SITT & Object Recognition", 1999: invariant features (SIFT feature)
- Face Detection, 2001
- Spatial Pyramid Matching, 2006: use features
- Histogram of gradients, 2005: use features
- Deformable part Model, 2009: using bounding boxes
- PASCAL Visual Object Challenge, 2006~2012: performances are getting better
- ImageNet
    - contribute to algorithm improvement
    - CNN, 2012

### 2. CS231n Overview
- Image classification, object detection, and image captioning will be covered
- Focus on **CNN**
    - Lecun et al, recognize digits, 1998 -> used the CNN concept for the first time
    - AlexNet, 2012 -> develops deep learning and increases layers
    - Advances in CNN: Improved hardwares and increased data contributed greatly
