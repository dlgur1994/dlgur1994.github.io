# Chap1. About Artificial Intelligence
## 1. What is AI?
### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AI: A system or a program to make human's intelligence  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tower of Hanoi (also called the Tower of Brahma or Lucas' Tower and sometimes pluralized as Towers) is a mathematical game or puzzle. It consists of three rods and a number of disks of different sizes, which can slide onto any rod. The puzzle starts with the disks in a neat stack in ascending order of size on one rod, the smallest at the top, thus making a conical shape. The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following simple rules.

## 2. What is Machine Learning?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whatever happens, eventually I have to move the blocks from the left bar to the right bar. Therefore, the blocks (total blocks-1) are moved to the middle bar, the bottom block is moved to the right bar, and the blocks from the middle bar are moved to the right bar. I used a recursive to divide the number of blocks into one and more.
