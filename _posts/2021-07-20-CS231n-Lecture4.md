### Backpropagation
- use the global gradient and local gradient to obtain all gradients

- ![3](/images/cs231n/lec4/3.png){: width="100%" height="100%"}
- patterns
    - add gate
        - gradient distributor
        - send the global gradient as it is
    - max gate
        - gradient router
        - global gradient is sent to the large value, and zero is sent to the small value
    - mul gate
        - gradient swithcer
        - exchange each other's values and send the values obtained by multiplying the global gradient
- gradients add at branches

    - $${df \over dx} = \sum_i {df \over dq_i} {dq_i \over dx}$$
- vectorized operations

    - Q. what is the size of the Jacobian matrix?
        - A. 4096 x 4096
        - entire minibatch (e.g. 100) of examples at one time: (409,600 x 409,600) matrix
        - in practice we process an
- vectorized example

### Neural Networks
- without the brain stuff
    - before
        - Linear score function $$f = Wx$$
    - now
        - 2-layer Neural Network $$f = W_2 max(0, W_1x)$$
        - 3-layer Neural Network $$f = W_3 max(0, W_2 max(0, W_1x))$$
- with the brain stuff
    - ![9](/images/cs231n/lec4/9.png){: width="100%" height="100%"}
    - biological neurons' differences
        - many different types
        - dendrites can perform complex non-linear computations
        - synapses are not a single weight but a complex non-linear dynamical system
        - rate code may not be adequate
